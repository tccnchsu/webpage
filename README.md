上次我們介紹怎麼用 Markdown 完成一本書, 這次我們來看 Markdown 可不可以做簡報。用 Markdown 做簡報, 其實就是輸出成 HTML, 用網頁做簡報。為什麼我們要選這個方案, 不用 PowerPoint, Keynote, LaTeX (Beamer) 等等方式呢? 對我來說, 有幾個很棒的因素:

通常比其他方案簡潔、快速
基本上就是個網頁, 所以像影像啦, GIF 動畫等等啦, 都是「本來就會」的。
用 Markdown 做很快速, 可以專注在內容上。

What is GitPitch?

GitPitch is a service that turns PITCHME.md markdown into online and offline, interactive slideshows. You can use it to promote, pitch or present absolutely anything.

Each slideshow presentation is made instantly available online just as soon as you git-commit and push PITCHME.md on any branch within a public GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, GitBucket, Gitea, or Gogs repo.

python-pptx is a Python library for creating and updating PowerPoint (.pptx) files.

A typical use would be generating a customized PowerPoint presentation from database content, downloadable by clicking a link in a web application. Several developers have used it to automate production of presentation-ready engineering status reports based on information held in their work management system. It could also be used for making bulk updates to a library of presentations or simply to automate the production of a slide or two that would be tedious to get right by hand.

More information is available in the python-pptx documentation.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/tccnchsu/webpage/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/tccnchsu/webpage/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
